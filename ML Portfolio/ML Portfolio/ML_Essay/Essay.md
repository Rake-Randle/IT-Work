    Given the rapid advancement of technology and AI, the increasing worry about what privacy we have in the world is now becoming more and more concerning. With AI being used in most technological advances at the moment, there are some key places AI are being used in, Surveillance systems, data privacy, algorithms and healthcare, these are just to name a few.

    Ai is being used in surveillance systems all across the world. Ai is constantly learning and being trained to be more efficient at facial recognition to detect people's faces in a split second. This may be great for security purposes but is it really ethical to know someones every movement? AI's use is great for this purpose and can help society with anything and especially is helpful for crimes; however, it is breaching everyone's privacy. It is tracking everyone, where they go and at what time, it is getting very powerful. It is unethical for this AI database to store so much information about you without you even knowing it is happening. These AI's are still training every second meaning they are getting more powerful and even more information about you whenever you are in sight of a serceillance system.
