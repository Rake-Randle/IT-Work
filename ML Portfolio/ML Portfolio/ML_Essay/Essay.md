# Privacy in the Age of AI: üîíü§ñ

## Navigating the Ethical Dimensions of Machine Learning üåê

**As of 2023, almost 93% of the world owns a phone meaning we can connect to everyone, when ever, where ever - and that isn't only humans, that can be AI too.**

Given the rapid advancement of technology and AI, the increasing worry about what privacy we have in the world is now becoming more and more concerning. With AI being used in most technological advances at the moment, there are some key places AI are being used in, Surveillance systems, data privacy, and healthcare, these are just to name a few.

Ai is being used in surveillance systems all across the world. Ai is constantly learning and being trained to be more efficient at facial recognition to detect people's faces in a split second. This may be great for security purposes but is it really ethical to know someones every movement? AI's use is great for this purpose and can help society with anything and especially is helpful for crimes; however, it is breaching everyone's privacy. It is tracking everyone, where they go and at what time, it is getting very powerful. It is unethical for this AI database to store so much information about you without you even knowing it is happening. These AIs are still training every second meaning they are getting more powerful and even more information about you whenever you are in sight of a surveillance system. To make this more ethical, there should be some sort of basic consent towards this idea or AI needs to limit and balance the data storage, such as balancing the benefits to it and the negatives to it so it is more ethical for the public. There should be a warning and an explanation of what the data is being used for and where it is going.

Many technologies use AI for the collection and utilization of personal data to store and filter incoming data. When putting sensitive data and any sort of response into a website, AI collects and sorts the data for the ease of the website, meaning AI is reading every sensitive information. Users dont understand that their information like credit card information, personal information and is being passed/ filtered and checked through AI. Does this mean it is still your data or is AI breaching your data? This is unethical of the use of AI to hold your information is misuse of data and breaching your own privacy. This is also being done with no consent or information that AI will be doing this to your personal information. With AI accessesing this data, AI is still learning and adding it to its data base while learning your personal data to make AI stronger and even more unethical. This misuse of data breaches ethics and privacy in the internet and will continue to breach information more and more.
